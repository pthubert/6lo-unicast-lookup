<section anchor="introduction"> <name>Introduction</name>
    <t>
    <xref target="RFC8505"/> defines the Routing Registrar and extends
    <xref target="RFC6775"/> to use a 6LoWPAN Border Router (6LBR) as a central
    service for Address Registration and duplicate detection amongst Routing
    Registrars and possibly individual Nodes that access it directly.
    </t>

    <t>
    <xref target="RFC8929"/> introduces the Backbone Router
    (6BBR) as a Routing Registrar that performs IPv6 ND <xref target="RFC4861"/>
    <xref target="RFC4862"/> proxy operation between IPv6 Nodes on a federating
    Backbone Link and Registering Nodes attached to a LowPower Lossy Networks
    (LLNs) that register their addresses to the 6BBR. The federated links form
    a Multilink Subnet (MLSN).
    </t>

    <t>
	The 6BBRs may exchange Extended Duplicate Address Messages (EDAR and EDAC)
    <xref target="RFC8505"/> to register the proxied addresses on behalf
    of the Registering Nodes to the 6LBR.
    The Registration Ownership Verifier (ROVR) field in the EDAR and EDAC messages
    is used to correlate attempts to register the same address and to detect
    duplications. The ROVR can also be used as a proof-of-ownership
    (see <xref target="RFC8928"/>) to protect the Registered
    address against theft and impersonation attacks
    (more in <xref target="I-D.bi-savi-wlan"/>).
    Conflicting registrations to different 6BBRs for the same Registered address
    are resolved using the TID field, which creates a temporal order and enables
    to recognize the freshest registration.
	</t>

    <t>
    With <xref target="RFC8929"/>,
    the Link Layer address (LLA) that the 6BBR advertises for a Registered
    address on behalf of the Registered Node over the Backbone can belong to the
    Registering Node; in that case, the 6BBR acts as a Bridging Proxy and
    bridges the unicast packets.  Alternatively, the LLA can be that of the 6BBR
    on the Backbone interface, in which case the 6BBR acts as a Routing Proxy,
	that receives the unicast packets at Layer-3 and routes them. The 6BBR
    signals that LLA in a Source LLA Option (SLLAO) in the EDAR messages to the
    6LBR, and the 6LBR responds with a Target LLA Option (TLLAO) that indicates
    the LLA associated to the current registration.
    </t>


	<t><xref target="I-D.ietf-6lo-multicast-registration">"IPv6 Neighbor
    Discovery Multicast Address Listener Registration"</xref> extends <xref
    target="RFC8505"/> to register anycast and multicast addresses. This entails
    accepting more than one registration for the same address and the use of
    the ROVR field as a complement to the index. In that case the 6LBR does not
    consider multiple registrations as duplicate and retains a state for the
    anycast addresses that it can use to reply a query.
    </t>


	<t>
    It results that the 6LBR is capable of providing the LLA mapping for any
    unicast and anycast address that was proactively registered with an SLLAO.
    This draft defines the protocol elements and the operations to try a unicast
    Layer-2 lookup with the 6LBR.
    This may save a reactive IPv6 ND Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message,
    which is based on multicast and may be problematic in extensive wireless
    domains (see <xref target="I-D.ietf-mboned-ieee802-mcast-problems"/>) as
    well as in large switched fabrics. In case of an anycast address, this draft
    does not provide a policy/ logic to select between multiple registrations.
    </t>


	<t>
    The registration and lookup services that the 6LBR provides do not have
    to be limited to 6BBRs and are available to any node that supports
    <xref target="RFC8505"/> and <xref target="RFC8929"/>
    to register an address, and / or this specification to resolve a mapping.
    The services are available on-link using an IPv6 NDP NS and off-link using
    a new variation of the Extended Duplicate Address messages called Address
    Mapping Messages. The policy and security settings that allow the access
    to the 6LBR are out of scope.

    <t>
    A 6LBR provides registration services for the purpose of proactive IPv6 ND
    and maintains a registry of the active registrations for unicast and anycast
    IPv6 addresses as an abstract data structure called an Address Registrar.
    An entry in the Address Registrar is called an "Address Registration".
    </t>

    <t>
    The Address Registration retains:</t>
    <ul>
        <li>
        the value for the ROVR associated to the registration, the current
        value of the TID, and the remaining Lifetime.
        </li>
        <li>
        a list of LLAs that are associated with the IPv6 address and can be
        used in a TLLAO as a response to a lookup.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <t>
    Examples where more than one address may be available include the case of
    an anycast address and the case of an LLN address that is proxied by more
    than one 6BBR.
    </t>

    <t>
	Unless otherwise configured, a 6LBR does the following:
    </t>
	<ul>
        <li>
        The 6LBR maintains an entry in the Address Registrar for any type of
        unicast and anycast addresses including those with link-local scope.
        </li>
        <li>
        Based on that entry, it provides duplicate avoidance services within the
        scope of its Address Registrar.
        </li>
        <li>
        The 6LBR also provides address lookup services for the Registered
        Address using unicast ICMPv6 DAR and DAC-based Address Mapping messages.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <t>
    The Address Mapping messages can be exchanged using global unicast
    addresses as source and destination addresses, so they can be used for
    both on-link and off-link queries.
    NS and NA messages may also be used, but in that case the unicast source
    and destination addresses are link-local addresses and the 6LBR must be
    on-link.
    </t>

    <t>
    The 6LBR proactive operations may coexist on the Backbone with reactive
    IPv6 ND <xref target="RFC4861"/><xref target="RFC4862"/> that rely on
    multicast for Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) and Address Lookup.
    Nodes that support this specification operate with the 6LBR before
    attempting the reactive operation, which may be avoided if the 6LBR
    is conclusive, either detecting a duplication or returning a mapping.
    </t>

<section anchor='updating'><name>Updating RFC 8505</name>

   <t>
	This specification leverages the capability to insert IPv6 ND options in
	the EDAR and EDAC messages that was introduced in
    <xref target="RFC8929"/>.
   </t>

   <t>
	It extends DAR and DAR ICMP messages for address lookup
    in <xref target="DAM"/> that use the same ICMP types as EDAR and EDAC but a
    different Code Prefix.
   </t>

   <t>
    It also adds a new Status "Not Found" in
    <xref target="earo"/>) that indicates that the address being searched is
    not present in the Address Registrar.
   </t>

   <t>
   A 6LBR signals itself by setting the "B" bit in the 6CIO of the RA
   messages that it generates <xref target="RFC8505"/>.
   This specification adds a new "A" bit in the 6CIO to indicate support of
   address mapping (see <xref target="CIO"/>).
   </t>


<section anchor='option'><name>Extended Neighbor Discovery Options and Messages</name>

   <t>This specification does not introduce new options; it modifies
   existing options and updates the associated behaviors.</t>

    <section anchor='CIO'><name>Extending the Capability Indication Option</name>
    <t>
	This specification defines a new capability bit for use in the 6CIO, as
	defined by <xref target="RFC7400"/> and extended in<xref target="RFC8505"/>
    for use in IPv6 ND messages.
    </t>
    <t>
	The new "A" bit indicates that the 6LBR provides address mapping
    services per this specification.

    <section anchor='DAM'><name>New Code Prefix for Address Mapping Messages</name>
    <t>
	The Extended Duplicate Address messages share a common base format defined
    in section 4.2 of <xref target="RFC8505"/>, with the ICMP type respectively
    set to 157 and 158 that is inherited from the DAR and DAC messages defined
    in section 4.4 of <xref target="RFC6775"/>. The ICMP Code is split in two
    4-bit fields, the Code Prefix and the Code Suffix, and the only Code
    Prefix defined in <xref target="RFC8505"/> is 0, signaling a DAD.
    </t>
    <t>
    The Address Mapping messages use the same values for the ICMP Type as the
    corresponding Extended Duplicate Address messages.
    This specification adds the Code Prefix of 1 to signal Address Mapping.
    ICMP messages with the ICMP type set to 157 or 158, and a Code Prefix of 1
    are thus respectively an Address Mapping Request (AMR) and an Address
    Mapping Confirm (AMC).

    </ul>

    The AMC is sent unicast the 6LBR to the querier.

    <t>
    A 6LBR that is deployed on-link SHOULD provide NS/NA-based services. It
    signals that support by setting the "L" bit in the 6CIO of the RA
    messages that it generates, indicating that it is a 6LR
    <xref target="RFC8505"/>.
    </t>

    <t>
    A 6LBR thus typically sets the "A", the "B", and the "L" bits when
    attached to a Backbone Link that it serves, as illustrated in
    <xref target='figBackbone'/>. In that case, the IPv6 Nodes and 6BBRs can
    use an NS/NA exchange with the 6LBR for both duplicate detection and lookup
    services.
    </t>

    <t>
    The NS(Lookup) is sent unicast from link-local address of the querier to
    the link-local address of the 6LBR. It carries a SLLAO
    <xref target="RFC4861"/> and it MUST NOT carry an EARO option to avoid the
    confusion with a registration.
    </t>

    <t>
    The 6LBR MUST respond with an NA message that contains an EARO.
    </t>
    <ul>
       <li> If the address is not present in the Address Registrar then the 6LBR
       MUST set the status to "Not Found". The ROVR, TID and Lifetime fields
       MUST be set to 0 and ignored by the receiver.
       </li>
       <li>
       Else if the address is present in the Address Registrar then the EARO
       fields MUST be set from the ROVR, TID and remaining Lifetime values in
       the Address Registration and the Status MUST be set to 0.
       </li>
       <li>
       If at least one LLA is found in the Address Registration, then the 6LBR
       MUST place one in a TLLAO option in the NA message.
       </li>
    </ul>
    <t>
    The NA is sent unicast from link-local address of the 6LBR to the link-local address of the querier.

<t>
    This specification extends <xref target="RFC8505"/>, and
    the security section of that document also applies to this document.
    In particular, the link layer SHOULD be sufficiently
    protected to prevent rogue access.

<section ><name>IANA Considerations</name>
<t>
	Note to RFC Editor, to be removed: please replace "This RFC"
	throughout this document by the RFC number for this specification
	once it is allocated.
</t>
<t>
    IANA is requested to make a number of changes under the
    "Internet Control Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6) Parameters"
    registry, as follows.
</t>

    <section><name>ICMP Codes</name>
    <t>
	IANA is requested to create 2 new subregistries of the ICMPv6 "Code"
        Fields registry, which itself is a subregistry of the Internet Control
        Message Protocol  version 6 (ICMPv6) Parameters for the ICMP codes.
        </t>
    <t>

        The new subregistries relate to the ICMP type
        157, Duplicate Address Request (shown in <xref target="DARcode"/>), and
        158, Duplicate Address Confirmation (shown in <xref target="DACcode"/>),
        respectively. For those two ICMP types, the ICMP Code field is split
	into 2 subfields, the "Code Prefix" and the "Code Prefix".  The new
	subregistries relate to the "Code Prefix" portion of the ICMP Code.
        The range of "Code Prefix" is 0..15 in all cases.
        The policy is "IETF Review" or "IESG Approval" <xref target="RFC8126"/>
        for both subregistries.
    </t>
    <t>
        The new subregistries are to be initialized as follows:
    </t>

   <table anchor="DARcode"><name>New Code Prefixes for ICMP type 157 DAR message</name>
   <thead>
      <tr><td>Code Prefix</td><td>Meaning</td><td>Reference</td></tr>

      <tr><td>2...15</td><td>Duplicate Address Detection</td><td></td></tr>
   </tbody>
   </table>     <!-- end table "New Code Prefixes for the DAR message" -->

   <table anchor="DACcode"><name>New Code Prefixes for ICMP type 158 DAC message</name>
   <thead>
      <tr><td>Code Prefix </td><td>Meaning</td><td>Reference</td></tr>
   </thead><tbody>
      <tr><td>0</td><td>Duplicate Address Detection</td><td>Duplicate Address Detection</td></tr>

      <tr><td>2...15</td><td>Duplicate Address Detection</td><td></td></tr>

   </tbody>
   </table>    <!-- end table "New Code Prefixes for the DAC message" -->


    </section>	<!-- end section "ICMP Codes" -->

    <section><name>New ARO Status values</name>
	<t> IANA is requested to make additions to the Address Registration
	    Option Status Values Registry as follows:
	</t>

	<table anchor="AROstat" ><name>New ARO Status values</name>
   <thead>
      <tr><td>ARO Status</td><td>Meaning</td><td>Reference</td></tr>
   </thead><tbody>
      <tr><td>11 (suggested)</td><td>Not Found</td><td>This RFC</td></tr>
   </tbody>
	</table>	<!-- end table "New ARO Status values" +-->
    </section>	<!-- end section "New ARO Status values" -->

    <section title="New 6LoWPAN Capability Bits">
	<t>
    IANA is requested to make additions to the Subregistry for
    "6LoWPAN Capability Bits" as follows:
	</t>

	<table anchor="CIOdat" ><name>New 6LoWPAN Capability Bits</name>
